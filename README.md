# docker-task-7.1-and-7.2
In this task we have created a Web Application for Docker (one of the great Containerization Tool which provides the user Platform as a Service (PaaS)) by showing our own creativity and UI/UX designing skills to make the web portal user friendly.

This app will help the user to run all the docker commands like:

docker images,
docker ps,
docker run,
docker rm -f,
docker exec,
etc. and try to cover the industry use cases also.
